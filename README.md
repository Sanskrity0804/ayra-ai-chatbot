2. It performs basic **sentiment analysis** using a lexicon of positive, negative, and emotional words.
3. It responds with context-aware, randomized replies while updating:
   - Response Count
   - Confidence Score
   - Response Time
4. All processing is done **locally in the browser**—no server required.
